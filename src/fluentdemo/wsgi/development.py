"""
Development WSGI config for fluentdemo project.

This module contains the WSGI application used by Django's development server.
Django's ``runserver`` and ``runfcgi`` commands discover this application
via the ``WSGI_APPLICATION`` setting.

Each production site can use one of the other modules in this folder;
the production/beta WSGI files auto-detect their system paths and location.
